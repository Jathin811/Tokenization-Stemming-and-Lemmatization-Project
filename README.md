# Tokenization, Stemming, and Lemmatization Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization. It utilizes the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) to process textual data. These techniques are fundamental in text preprocessing for applications like text classification, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval.

## Features

- **Tokenization**: Splits text into sentences and words.
- **Stemming**: Reduces words to their root form using algorithms like `PorterStemmer`.
- **Lemmatization**: Converts words to their dictionary base form using `WordNetLemmatizer`.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **nltk**: A popular NLP library for text processing.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.7 or later). To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install nltk
Usage
Run the script in a Python environment or execute the Jupyter Notebook cells sequentially. Example usage:

python
Copy
Edit
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
Expected Output
Tokenized words and sentences.
Stemmed words.
Lemmatized words with their dictionary base form.
Potential Improvements
Add support for multiple languages.
Implement custom stopword removal.
Integrate Named Entity Recognition (NER) for advanced text processing.
